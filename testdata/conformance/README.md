# AKG test files

This directory contains small `.akg` files that other implementations can use to check whether they read AKG the same way the Go reference implementation does.

Think of each file as an example with an expected answer:

- **accept** means “a normal AKG reader should open this.”
- **reject** means “a normal AKG reader should refuse this.”

Some files are healthy examples. Some are intentionally broken. The broken ones are just as important: they make sure readers fail closed instead of silently accepting bad data.

## Start here: `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is the table of contents for this directory. Every `.akg` file must appear there exactly once. The Go tests fail if a file is missing from the manifest, if the manifest points at a file that does not exist, or if the recorded hash no longer matches the file bytes.

A minimal entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "path": "fixture-name.akg",
  "purpose": "Human-readable reason this file exists.",
  "expected_result": "accept",
  "validation_scope": "store",
  "sha256": "..."
}
```

Fields:

- `path` — file name, relative to this directory.
- `purpose` — why this file exists.
- `expected_result` — `accept` or `reject`.
- `expected_error_category` — required for `reject` files. Exact error strings can differ between implementations; this is the stable category to compare.
- `validation_scope` — `format` for low-level container/section behavior, `store` for ordinary open/validation behavior.
- `sha256` — hash of the exact file bytes. If the bytes change, this changes.
- `generated_by` — for accepted files, notes the deterministic Go reference workflow that produced the file.
- `corruption` — for rejected files, explains what was intentionally damaged.
- `store_expectation` — optional extra checks used by the Go reference tests, such as node count, edge count, and WAL sequence expectations.

If you are writing another AKG reader, the main loop is simple: load `manifest.json`, read each `path`, then check whether your reader accepts or rejects it as declared. Go test names and Go error messages can be useful clues while debugging, but they are not the cross-implementation contract. The stable contract is the manifest: `expected_result` plus `expected_error_category` for rejected files.

## Checking the files

Run the focused checks:

```sh
go test -count=1 ./internal/format ./internal/store
go run ./internal/cmd/conformance-fixtures -dir testdata/conformance
```

The helper command verifies two things:

1. the bytes on disk still match the `sha256` values in `manifest.json`;
2. `store`-scoped files still accept or reject as declared.

To print the current hashes while reviewing a change:

```sh
go run ./internal/cmd/conformance-fixtures -dir testdata/conformance -print-hashes
```

## Updating a test file safely

Changing one of these files is allowed, but it should be rare and deliberate. Treat `.akg` files in this directory as reference specimens: if they change in a PR, reviewers should slow down and ask why.

Use this workflow:

1. Make the code or fixture change.
2. Run the focused checks above.
3. Run the full suite: `go test -count=1 ./...`.
4. Review the fixture-byte change.
5. Update the file’s `sha256` in `manifest.json` only after you understand why the bytes changed.
6. If the file is intentionally broken, update its `corruption` note so the damage is easy to audit later.

Please do not submit hash-only churn. A hash change without an explained file change is suspicious by design. In reviews, any changed `.akg` file or changed manifest hash deserves extra attention, even if the tests pass.

Generated valid files should be stable across repeated local runs. Fixture generation should avoid wall-clock timestamps and random IDs; timestamps, IDs, section ordering, Data key ordering, Bloom parameters, and WAL sequences should be fixed by the fixture workflow.

## Current files

### Milestone 1

- `m1-data-bloom-wal.akg` — a low-level container example with Data, Bloom, and WAL sections.

### Milestone 2 accepted files

These should open normally:

- `m2-empty-create.akg` — an empty graph created by the reference implementation.
- `m2-minimal-node.akg` — one minimal node after compaction.
- `m2-full-node.akg` — one populated node with body, tags, and metadata.
- `m2-single-edge.akg` — two nodes and one edge after compaction.
- `m2-small-graph.akg` — a small graph with mixed node types, tags, and edges.
- `m2-committed-wal-replay.akg` — base Data plus committed WAL records that ordinary open must replay.
- `m2-uncommitted-wal-tail.akg` — committed WAL followed by uncommitted trailing bytes that ordinary open must ignore.
- `m2-compacted.akg` — live Data/Bloom after compaction, with no carried-forward WAL.
- `m2-deletes-before-compaction.akg` — WAL history with deletes before the final committed state.

### Milestone 2 rejected files

These are intentionally damaged and should not open normally:

- `m2-reject-malformed-committed-wal.akg` — starts from a valid empty store plus a committed WAL batch, then flips a byte inside the committed WAL record. Ordinary open must reject it.
- `m2-reject-derived-index-mismatch.akg` — starts from a valid graph, then damages the derived-index Data keys so they no longer match the primary node/edge records. Ordinary open must reject it.
